This software has a primitive GPG Python API that duplicates the work
of at least two other libraries. The `pythong-gnupg` library is
particularly similar and communication was started to consider the
possibility of merging. This section details how we should deal with
this.

 * decide to merge or split from pythong-gnupg (done: we merge)
   - for merge arguments:
     - gnupg has more history and authors
     - has more features (see below)
     - avoid project proliferation (already 4 python APIs to gpg)
     - may be less work
   - against merge arguments:
     - needs to rewrite monkeysign again (fairly easy)
     - i just spend about 20 hours in two days on this project
     - python-gnupg doesn't seem to have a VCS
     - hosted on code.google.com, BSD license (minor)
 * apply those improvements to python-gnupg
   - add key signing support
   - split the "context" and "keyring" classes
   - port monkeysign to python-gnupg
   - make sure python-gnupg is secure (ie. that it doesn't use
     popen([...], shell=True), see below

It seems that we have a new upstream for python-gnupg that resolves
most problems documented here:

https://github.com/isislovecruft/python-gnupg

We are in contact with upstream and they are open to merging in
changes, so we will go in that direction.
