work has started on this in the dev/monkeysign branch

i don't hope to create the keyring class, i am not sure i see the
point anymore

found a bug upstream, see: https://github.com/isislovecruft/python-gnupg/pull/61

the biggest hurdle here will be key signing, that is missing right now
from upstream
