we want the options from the commandline available from the GTK user
interface.

while it's currently possible to pass those same commandline arguments
to the GTK UI, it's not really practical, and clearly
counter-intuitive.

should this be a "preferences" wizard?

should the options be stored? if so, consider the `configparser` and
`json` modules.
