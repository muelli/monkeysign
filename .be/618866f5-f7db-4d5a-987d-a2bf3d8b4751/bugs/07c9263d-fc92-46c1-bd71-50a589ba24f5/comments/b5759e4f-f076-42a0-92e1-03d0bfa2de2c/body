before this happens, the GTK UI needs to be able to [sign arbitrary
fingerprints][1], but also achieve feature parity with the commandline
interface (through preferences, for example, see bug be:618/a08).

one of the issues here is how to tell the binary to stay in
commandline-only mode. we can detect DISPLAY and fail gracefully
there, but should there be a --cli option?

the way "kedpm" does this is by having symlinks to "kedpm-cli" and
"kedpm-gtk", and commandline flags "--cli" and "--gtk" - this seems
like a good approach.
