glade now produces GTK3 XML files which are *not* backwards compatible.

for the future, it would be important to port to GTK3 anyways.

furthermore, there seems to be significant improvements to the API, as
can be seen in the glade test drives in doc/ui-mockups.

Documentation is sparse, however:

https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject
http://readthedocs.org/docs/python-gtk-3-tutorial/en/latest/index.html

Here's how to port:

It's a lot of work, but since we may rewrite the GTK ui from scratch
anyways, we might as well just start with that!
