Release process
===============

 * make sure tests pass (`./test.py`)
 * update version in `monkeysign/__init__.py` and run `dch -i -D unstable`
 * signed and annotated tag (`git tag -s -u keyid x.y`)
 * build Debian package (`git-buildpackage`)
 * install and test Debian package (`dpkg -i ../build-area/monkeysign_*.deb`)
 * upload Debian package
 * push commits and tags to the git repository
 * add announcement on website and mailing list <monkeysphere@lists.riseup.net>

Support schedule
================

The 2.0.x branch will be featured in Debian Jessie and will therefore
be maintained for security fixes for the lifetime of that release. New
development will then happen on the 3.0 branch, and some features may
be backported in 2.x point releases.

Bug tracking
============

Bug tracking happens in this git repository using `be`
([bugs-everywhere][]). [Full documentation][] is available online, but
here's a short overview:

    # list bugs
    be list
    # new bug
    be new "here's a summary"
    # describe / comment on a bug
    be comment 618/d0d0
    # register all changes in git
    be commit

A more convenient HTML view can be served using:

    be html

Use the `--port` option if port 8000 is busy with icecast.
