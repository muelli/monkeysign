Release process
===============

 * make sure tests pass
 * update version in gpg.py and run dch -i
 * signed and annotated tag
 * create and publish tarball
 * add announcement on website and blog

1.0 blockers
============

The following needs to be fixed before 1.0 is released.

 o [anarcat] decide if we should copy gpg.conf in the tmp keyring
 * make options configuration accessible from the GUI (preferences?)
 * add a manpage
   - maybe this madness? https://andialbrecht.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/creating-a-man-page-with-distutils-and-optparse/
 * merge monkeysign-scan and monkeysign-cli
   - detect if the zbar libraries and X11 are present
 * merge monkeysign-scan and monkeysign-gen
   - display the qrcode in monkeysign-scan
 * send one email per uid even if we sign them all
   - involves calling export on a different gpg home for each uid in
   sign_keys (i think)

Nice to haves
=============

The software should be tagged and release even without those.

 o [anarcat] make sure we can apply improvements to python-gnupg
 o [anarcat] decide to merge or split from pythong-gnupg
   - for merge arguments:
     - gnupg has more history and authors
     - has more features (see below)
     - avoid project proliferation (already 4 python APIs to gpg)
     - may be less work
   - against merge arguments:
     - needs to rewrite monkeysign again (fairly easy)
     - i just spend about 20 hours in two days on this project
     - python-gnupg doesn't seem to have a VCS
     - hosted on code.google.com, BSD license (minor)
 * if merging, apply those improvements to python-gnupg
   - add key signing support
   - split the "context" and "keyring" classes
   - monkeysign also needs to be ported
 * if not merging, take those improvements from python-gnupg
   - improve test suite
   - add abstract status handlers that react on a main read loop
     instead of expect-like functionality
   - add support for verification, key generation and deletion
   - support streams of I/O
   - use threads?
   - move the TempKeyring class to a monkeysign lib?
 * see if monkeysphere is interested in automatically generated tarballs
