Blockers
========

A small list of things to do before this is officially released as
0.1.

 o [anarcat] hook into python's install procedures
   - use distutils, see setup.py in python-gnupg

 o [anarcat] finish monkeysign-scan
   - migrate the MIME handling code to a common class or to the library?
   - may require merging with monkeysign-cli (below)

 * merge with monkeysphere.info
   - publish code upstream on monkeysphere.info
   - make a webpage explaining common uses

 * release process
   - signed and annotated tag
   - create and publish tarball
   - add announcement on website and blog

Nice to haves
=============

The software should be tagged and release even without those.

 o [anarcat] make a debian package
 o [anarcat] make sure we can apply improvements to python-gnupg
 o [anarcat] decide to merge or split from pythong-gnupg
   - for merge arguments:
     - gnupg has more history and authors
     - has more features (see below)
     - avoid project proliferation (already 4 python APIs to gpg)
     - may be less work
   - against merge arguments:
     - needs to rewrite monkeysign again (fairly easy)
     - i just spend about 20 hours in two days on this project
     - python-gnupg doesn't seem to have a VCS
     - hosted on code.google.com, BSD license (minor)
 * if merging, apply those improvements to python-gnupg
   - add key signing support
   - split the "context" and "keyring" classes
   - monkeysign also needs to be ported
 * if not merging, take those improvements from python-gnupg
   - improve test suite
   - add abstract status handlers that react on a main read loop
     instead of expect-like functionality
   - add support for verification, key generation and deletion
   - support streams of I/O
   - use threads?
   - move the TempKeyring class to a monkeysign lib?
 * see if monkeysphere is interested in automatically generated tarballs
 * add a manpage
   - maybe this madness? https://andialbrecht.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/creating-a-man-page-with-distutils-and-optparse/
 * merge monkeysign-scan and monkeysign-cli
   - use a parent class for argument passing and Gpg wrappers
   - detect if the zbar libraries and X11 are present
 * merge monkeysign-scan and monkeysign-gen
   - display the qrcode in monkeysign-scan
 * get rid of the pyme dependencies
   - just removing monkeysign-gen should be enough
