Native Python / GPG API

This API was written to replace the GPGME bindings because the GPGME
API has a few problems:

 1. it is arcane and difficult to grasp
 2. it is very closely bound to the internal GPG data and commandline
    structures, which are quite confusing
 3. GPGME doesn't actually talk to a GPG library, but interacts with
    GPG through the commandline
 4. GPGME developers are not willing to extend GPGME to cover private
    key material management and consider this is outside the scope of
    the project.

The latter two points are especially problematic for this project, and
I have therefore started working on a replacement.

Operations are performed mostly through the Keyring or KeyringTmp
class (if you do not want to access your regular keyring but an empty
temporary one).

This is how you can access keys, which are represented by the
OpenPGPkey datastructure, but which will not look in your keyring or
on the keyservers itself without the Keyring class.
